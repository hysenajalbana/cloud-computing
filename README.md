# Managing access to Amazon Web Services


AWS offers the possibility to give users restricted access to an AWS account by creating Identity and Access Management (IAM) sub-accounts. This is useful when an organization is the owner (and payer) of the account and the organization wants to enable a group of people to use AWS services in a controlled manner. The objective of this project is to develop scripts that help administrate IAM accounts (create account, set password, change rights, revoke account) for a group of users using the AWS API.
